theBigRace
==========

This program calculates the race between the turtle and the rabbit one step at a time. At each step, the turtle increases position by 40. The rabbit will either increase position by 100 or 0, depending on if he got distracted. The user receieves an alert for every step of the race, and one final alert after one or both of the racers crosses the finish line (which is when they reach position 1000) and says who won or if it was a tie.

theBiggerRace
=============
A bigger race which involves 5 different animals, each of which run in very different fashions. The basic mechanics are the same as in theBigRace, except the 3 new animals have different quirks. The fox will go slowly looking for a shortcut 70% of the time, and the other 30% it will find a shortcut and advance a random number from 101-200. The sloth advances 1 per turn, but has a 1% chance per turn of instantly teleporting to the end. The puppy runs 100 per turn, but has a 30% chance of going backward and decreasing its position by 100.
